An extension of the Financial Factor Analysis work done in the preprint paper Optimal Linear Baseline Models for Scientific Machine Learning. Aims to understand the economic significance of the latent spaces found by our Optimal Affine Linear Autoencoder on market data. Data collection and autoencoder frameworks/training are detailed in the corresponding repository: https://github.com/alexdelise/CMDS-REU-MADDI.

More to come.
