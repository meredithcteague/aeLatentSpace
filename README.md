# Latent space temporal analysis for financial generative modelling
An extension of the Financial Factor Analysis work done in the preprint paper Optimal Linear Baseline Models for Scientific Machine Learning. Aims to model and understand temporal patterns 
of AE latent space.

 Data collection and autoencoder frameworks/training are detailed in the corresponding repository: https://github.com/alexdelise/CMDS-REU-MADDI.
